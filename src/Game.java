/**
 * This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application.
 * "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users
 * can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended
 * to make it more interesting!
 *
 * Upadated 01/2018 - The game scenario puts the player in the role of a prisoner. The goal
 * is to escape from the high risk cell block of Zuul prison.
 *
 * To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 * method.
 *
 * This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 * rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 * executes the commands that the parser returns.

/**
 * Class Room - a room in an adventure game.
 *
 * This class is part of the "World of Zuul" application. 
 * "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  
 *
 * A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game.  It is 
 * connected to other rooms via exits.  The exits are labelled north, 
 * east, south, west.  For each direction, the room stores a reference
 * to the neighboring room, or null if there is no exit in that direction.
 * 
 * @author  Michael KÃ¶lling and David J. Barnes & Brian Hurst
 * @version 2018.01.23
 * 
 * - Changed the fields to private
 * - Added getExit accessor method
 * - Added getExitString method so that the exits are now prepared by the Room class
 * - Dulpicated getExit and getExitString methods then commented them out for grading purposes
 * - Imported HashMap library 
 * - Added HashMap for room exits 
 * - Modified the constructor to make use of the HashMap      
 * - Modified setExits method
 * - Imported Set library 
 * - Modified getExitString method 
 * - Added getLongDescription method
 * 
 * - Imported ArrayList
 * - Imported Iterator
 * - Added items Arraylist field 
 * - Created new items ArrayList in constructor
 * - Added addItem method
 * - Added removeItem method
 *      -(this will be used once an inventory system is implemented)
 * - Added printListOfItems method
 * - Modified printListOfItems method
 * - Added getItemByName method 
 *      -(this will be used once an inventory system is implemented)
 * - updated javadoc
